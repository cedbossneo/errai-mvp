Errai-MVP

errai-mvp is an MVN framework for JBoss Errai based on the popular gwt-platform framework.

Almost all gwt-platform functionalities are present.

I will publish some Wiki pages and a demo.

To use, please download the master branch and compile the library with maven.

If you would like to contribute, contact me.
